# Hotel-Reservation-Dataset-With-SQL
# Summary
Within this internship, i worked with a hotel reservation dataset to extract insights into guest preferences, booking patterns, and critical factors affecting hotel operations. Utilizing SQL, i was able to analyze the data and address particular inquiries regarding the dataset, contributing to informed decision-making and enhanced guest experiences in the hotel industry.

# Dataset Description
The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
2. no_of_adults: The count of adults in the reservation.
3. no_of_children: The count of children in the reservation.
4. no_of_weekend_nights: The number of reservation nights falling on weekends.
5. no_of_week_nights: The number of reservation nights falling on weekdays.
6. type_of_meal_plan: The selected meal plan by the guests.
7. room_type_reserved: The reserved room type by the guests.
8. lead_time: The duration in days between booking and arrival.
9. arrival_date: The date of arrival.
10. market_segment_type: The market segment classification of the reservation.
11. avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation.
12. booking_status: The status of the booking.

# The task is to analyze the hotel reservation dataset using SQL by writing queries to answer specific questions. 
Below are 11 questions for which i created SQL queries to gain insights:
