# Hotel-Reservation-Dataset-With-SQL
# Summary
Within this internship, i worked with a hotel reservation dataset to extract insights into guest preferences, booking patterns, and critical factors affecting hotel operations. Utilizing SQL, i was able to analyze the data and address particular inquiries regarding the dataset, contributing to informed decision-making and enhanced guest experiences in the hotel industry.

# Dataset Description
The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
2. no_of_adults: The count of adults in the reservation.
3. no_of_children: The count of children in the reservation.
4. no_of_weekend_nights: The number of reservation nights falling on weekends.
5. no_of_week_nights: The number of reservation nights falling on weekdays.
6. type_of_meal_plan: The selected meal plan by the guests.
7. room_type_reserved: The reserved room type by the guests.
8. lead_time: The duration in days between booking and arrival.
9. arrival_date: The date of arrival.
10. market_segment_type: The market segment classification of the reservation.
11. avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation.
12. booking_status: The status of the booking.

# The task is to analyze the hotel reservation dataset using SQL by writing queries to answer specific questions. 
Below are 11 questions for which i created SQL queries to gain insights:

1. Determine the total number of reservations in the dataset.
2. Identify the most popular meal plan among guests.
3. Calculate the average price per room for reservations involving children.
4. Count how many reservations were made for a specific year (replace XX with the desired year).
5. Find out the most commonly booked room type.
6. Determine the number of reservations that fall on a weekend (where no_of_weekend_nights > 0).
7. Identify the highest and lowest lead time for reservations.
8. Determine the most common market segment type for reservations.
9. Count the number of reservations with a booking status of "Confirmed."
10. Calculate the total number of adults and children across all reservations.
11. Determine the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children.
12. Determine the number of reservations made in each month of the year.
13. Calculate the average number of nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type.
14. Identify the most common room type for reservations involving children, and calculate the average price for that room type.
15. Find the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.
